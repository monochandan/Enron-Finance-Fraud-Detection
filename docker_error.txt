###################### DOCKER CMD ##############################

# build a docker image defined by docker-compose.yml file
docker compose up --build



store the image in the dockerhub: This command pushes the Docker images 
associated with your Docker Compose services to a container 
registry (like Docker Hub or another private registry) if you've tagged
 them appropriately with the registry URL and repository name.

docker compose push


## now download the image in the local docker from dockerhub
docker login

docker run -p5000:5000 chandanmonotosh554/enron-img
